# Containerized-ETL-System
This is a side project I am working on for my uncle, aiming to manage data more efficiently and sustainably in the long term.

**Note that this only applies to the KiotViet data source.**

# Description Content
• Implement Apache Airflow on Docker Container hosted on VirtualBox Machine running Ubuntu 20.04.

• Implement PostgreSQL Database and design schemas, boost performance by applying optimal indexing and partitioning strategy as well as defining various triggers and constraints.

• Define Airflow DAGs to multiple ETLmodes (Daily, Backfill).

• Execute data quality checks.

• Toolkit: Python, DBEaver, VirtualBox, Linux, Postman.

# Instructions for use:  
• Install your **airflow** with the following:

sudo chmod +x start.sh

./start.sh

• Log in UI with username:**airflow** and password: **airflow**.

• Read README.md in dags/sonata to build your pipeline to integrate data from **KiotViet** to **PostgreSQL**.
